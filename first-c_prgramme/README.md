# Writing My First C Programme
  The focus of this project is to explore the basic syntax of a simple C programme by exploring the following:
	- The `#include` directive
	- Header files
	- Comments
	- The `main()` function
	- The return statement
	- The `exit()` function
	- The newline character `(\n)`
	- The void data type
	- translating a C programme into an executable file
	- Debuffing
