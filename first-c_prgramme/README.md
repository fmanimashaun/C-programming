# Writing My First C Programme
  The focus of this project is to explore the basic syntax of a simple C programme by exploring the following:
  - The `#include` directive
  - Header files
  - Comments
  - The `main()` function
  - The return statement
  - The `exit()` function
  - The newline character `(\n)`
  - The void data type
  - translating a C programme into an executable file
  - Debuffing
